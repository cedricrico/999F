                        <h1>What is the main purpose of 999F</h1>
                               <p>The main purpose of the 999 foundation is to bring hope to the ones that had suffered worst into the world,<br>
                                We are trying to develope a friendly community that will share there dreams to help other people people physically and emotionally
                                  
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                floated the idea via Facebook to hold a supposedly one-time parenting seminar. Chay Saputil,<br>
                                 who was promoting online safety for a software company volunteered to help out. Carlo Ople, who was a gamer then,<br>
                                  also volunteered to share his experience so parents will be enlightened about the effects of gaming.  Girlie Corda, who was into creatives and strategic communications,<br>
                                   volunteered to do the creative materials for us. The seminar was an instant hit, and the learning event has become one of the sought-after seminars for parents.<br>
                                 Thus, the first phase of the cyber wellness campaign was born.<br>

                                 <br>
                                 <br>
                                 In recent years, there has been increasing acknowledgement of the important role mental health plays in achieving global development goals,<br>
                                  as illustrated by the inclusion of mental health in the Sustainable Development Goals. Depression is one of the leading causes of disability. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. <br>
                                  People with severe mental health conditions die prematurely as much as two decades early due to preventable physical conditions.

                                  <br>
                                  <br>
                                  
                                  Many mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost,<br>
                                   yet the gap between people needing care and those with access to care remains substantial. Effective treatment coverage remains extremely low.
                                 <br>
                                 <br>


                                   That is why we build The 999F to help all people that felt that they are lonely in this world,<br>
                                   We will Take The HELL(666) That you are suffering in life, we will help you to turn that Devil(666) in your life and and make it, <br>
                                   pure positivity(999) That will make you feel to get your life going because we all believe in equality
